# Object-tracing-with-YOLOv5



## Introduction 
* Developing an end to end deep learning model using YOLOv5 to detect the vehicles in realtime on national highways 
* As of now, we used the classes in the coco dataset to classify the detected vehicles into classes but in future we are looking forward to categorise them based on the NHAI classification into 16 classes
* Created a dashboard to update the list of vehicles passisng through an imaginary line drawn on screen
